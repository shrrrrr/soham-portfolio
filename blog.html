                "I began exploring web development during my first year of college in my bachelor's degree. However, due to the heavy exam load and a change in my academic focus, I didn't get many opportunities to practice web development projects at that time.
</div>
<div class="para2">
But over the past month, I've dedicated a substantial amount of time to learning and honing my web development skills. I've delved into essential technologies and tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap framework. The learning process has been thrilling, and I'm now eager to explore other JavaScript libraries, such as Node.js and Angular.
</div>
<div class="para3">
In the upcoming months, my goal is to dive into backend technologies and create unique and exciting projects. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my web development journey.
