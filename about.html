                I am a 22-year-old from India and I am currently studying Computer Science and Information security at
                IIIT
                HYDREBAD.

                I have been programming since I was admitted to College and I absolutely love it. I also have experience
                in
                Competitive Programming. I am now interested in startups and it will very likely be my future career!
                </div>

                <div class="am3">
                    I was a 10-year-old who had a deep love for both computer and outdoor games. Growing up in a
                    household where
                    both my parents worked in the educational field, they exposed me to various math and science topics,
                    fueling
                    my curiosity and interest in subjects like mathematics and computer science.
                </div>

                <div class="am4"> Upon entering college, I embarked on a journey of exploration, delving into
                    theoretical subjects related to
                    computer science and emerging technologies. It was during my second year of bachelor's degree that I
                    was
                    introduced to competitive programming, and ever since, I have been relentlessly practicing coding
                    questions
                    and thoroughly enjoying the process of problem-solving. As a programmer, the word "accepted" brings
                    immense
                    joy and satisfaction to my mind.
                </div>
                <div class="am5">
                    Beyond my passion for programming, I possess an unwavering eagerness to push my limits and
                    accomplish new
                    feats. I am constantly driven to learn and enhance my skills, dedicating myself to self-improvement
                    each
                    day. For instance, if you have any constructive criticism or suggestions regarding a recently
                    created
                    website, I would greatly appreciate your input as I am always seeking opportunities for growth.
